# Snakey
This is my first Pygame experience! It's a snake game with custom sprites, had a lot of fun making this one, I've learned a lot through this project, it was made as a school homework (but it wasn't supposed to be exactly a game, I just took it to another level lol).
The pixel arts were made by my friend, and I made the back end part of this!

# How to install
Besides [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), you aditionally need Pygame to run this code. You can install it using the following command on the terminal:
```
pip install pygame
```

After installing pygame, you can clone the files to your computer using the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/MoisesLN/Snakey.git
cd Snakey
```
To run the game, just do the following line (when you're in the Snakey file):
```
py Snakey.py
```
