# Snakey
This is my first Pygame experience! It's a snake game with custom sprites, had a lot of fun making this one, I've learned a lot through this project, it was made as a school homework (but it wasn't supposed to be exactly a game, I just took it to another level lol).
The pixel arts were made by my friend, and I made the back end part of this!
